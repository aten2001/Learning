/*
 * 
 * Nuts and bolts. 
 * A disorganized carpenter has a mixed pile of N nuts and N bolts. 
 * The goal is to find the corresponding pairs of nuts and bolts.
 * Each nut fits exactly one bolt and each bolt fits exactly one nut. 
 * By fitting a nut and a bolt together, the carpenter can see which one is bigger 
 * (but the carpenter cannot compare two nuts or two bolts directly). 
 * Design an algorithm for the problem that uses NlogN compares (probabilistically).
 * Hint: modify the quicksort partitioning part of quicksort.
Remark: This research paper gives an algorithm that runs in Nlog4N time in the worst case.
