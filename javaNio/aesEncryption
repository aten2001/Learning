Encryption:
 2 basic types 
  - Asymetric - public and private key
   - encrypt with public and a matching private key for decryption
   - private key can decrypt
   or reversible roles of private and public
  - Symetric
   symetrics uses  one private key for both encryption and decryption

   PKI - public key i - used when we have 2 differen end points like client and server (VPN servers, secure shell ssh, websites, sftp) 

Symetric encryption in apps storing db and getting from db
symetric encryption is way faster than asymetric. 
Symetrics encryption is simpler

twoFish, blowFish , 3DES, AES - encryption Algo
DES - data encryption standard
AES - advanced encryption standard
